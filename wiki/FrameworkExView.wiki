=Example: Create the View=
The view is a [http;//www.smarty.net Smarty] object that loads the correspondent template in order to generate the html for the page.
In The Framework, the views are organized inside the View folder. Inside this folder there must be 2/3 directories: 
  * cache - Holds the cached files generated by Smarty
  * template - Holds the .tpl files
  * template_c - Holds the compiled templates

Start by creating a folder with the same name as the controller inside the templates folder - in lowercase - and a template with the same name as the action:
View -> templates -> hello -> world.tpl

Put this code inside the world.tpl file:
{{{
<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd">
<html>
    <head></head>
    <body>
        Hello {$name}
    </body>
</html>
}}}

The $name variable is the assigned variable in [FrameworkExAction Create the Action] which is now usable inside the smarty tags.
